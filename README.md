#  ðŸ˜‚ Programming JÃ¶Ã¶k ðŸ¤£
## The ultimate programming joke collection

What can you do?
- it gets a random joke and displays the punchline after a thrilling 4 second period
- you can share your favorite joke on facebook or twitter
- it has Rupert the cat, say hi to him for me 

This was made in 4 hours as a joke, to impress the teacher at my bootcamp Codaisseur. We were supposed to prepare for a mock tech interview and explain our process, but instead I made the app real instead! Joke's on him now! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
